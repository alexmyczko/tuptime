| OSX notes - Tuptime |
=======================


Tuptime is compatible with OSX, which comes with 'python' installed by default.

But for now, I haven't found a clean way to configure a Launchd task to be 
executed before shutdown, so, Tuptime can't register the whole time and the 
shutdown status.

The closest approach is to have a Launchd plist that runs at startup and each
minute. The drawbacks will be an error range <60 secs. and a BAD shutdown
status always.

To install the .plist, copy file to the right location:

    # git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/rfmoz/tuptime.git
    # cp src/launchd/localhost.tuptime.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/

Load it:

    # launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/localhost.tuptime.plist
